# Password-Vault
This is an application that I made that stores usernames and passwords.

The interface is quite simple. All the icons are clean, simple and are intuitive to use.

All your information is heavily encrypted using a cipher algorithm that I created myself. The algorithm itself is a complex polyalphabetic cipher that utilizes randomly generated key progressions. There are more than 10^142 possible key progressions that can be utilized.
