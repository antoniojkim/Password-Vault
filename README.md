# Password-Vault
This is an application that I made that stores usernames and passwords.

The interface is quite simple. All the icons are clean, simple and are intuitive to use.

All your information is heavily encrypted using a cipher algorithm included in a library that I wrote. The algorithm itself is a complex polyalphabetic cipher that utilizes randomly generated key progressions. There are 144! (or about 10^250) possible key progressions that can be utilized.
