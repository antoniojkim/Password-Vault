# Password-Vault
This is an application that I made that stores usernames and passwords.

The interface is quite simple. All the icons are clean, simple and are intuitive to use.

All your information is heavily encrypted using a cipher algorithm that I created myself. My algorithm was inspired by the principles of the vignere cipher but it is much more advanced. I read somewhere that using a version of the vignere cipher with a random key that is never used more than once is theoretically impossible to crack. That is what inspired me to create the algorithm.
