# Password-Vault
This is an application that I made that stores usernames and passwords.

It utilizes the cipher algorithm included in my [encryption libary](https://github.com/antoniok9130/Encryption-Library)

The interface is quite simple. All the icons are clean, simple and are intuitive to use.
